/**
 * CHANGELOG
 * - tweaked scaling to make dice look nice on mobile
 * - removed dice selector feature (separating UI from dice roller)
 * - file reorg (moving variable declarations to top, followed by public then private functions)
 * - removing true random option (was cool but not worth the extra dependencies or complexity)
 * - removing mouse event bindings (separating UI from dice roller)
 * - refactoring to module pattern and reducing publically available properties/methods
 * - removing dice notation getter callback in favour of setting dice to roll directly
 * - adding sound effect
 * - adding roll results to notation returned in after_roll callback
 * - adding 'd9' option (d10 to be added to d100 properly)
 * - fixed init/resize inside hidden containers: size-dependent setup (camera, light,
 *   barriers, desk) moved out of the constructor and into reinit(), which now no-ops
 *   until the container has real dimensions. Replaced the broken/non-functional
 *   'resize' event binding (elements don't fire native resize events, callback had
 *   wrong `this`, and `elem` was undefined) with a ResizeObserver that calls reinit()
 *   once the container becomes visible/sized. Added camera guards to __animate/render
 *   calls so nothing renders with an undefined camera.
 * - after a roll settles, dice are auto-lined-up along the top edge of the desk
 *   (line_up_dice) so the lower part of the canvas stays clear for a message/options
 *   UI. Configurable via vars.lineup_* and can be skipped by passing false to
 *   start_throw/roll's after_roll usage pattern (see line_up_dice).
 * - added reroll(notation_indices, before_reroll, after_reroll): re-throws only
 *   the selected dice (by stable notation_index) while every other die stays
 *   exactly where it's lined up; results merge back into last_notation and
 *   everyone is re-lined-up together once settled. Added set_dice_selected()
 *   for a tap-to-pick highlight, and fixed search_dice_by_mouse() (previously
 *   returned an always-empty userData object) so it now returns the tapped die
 *   mesh directly.
 * - increased the edge/corner chamfer on every die shape (d4/d6/d8/d10/d12/d20,
 *   which d9/d100 also inherit) so edges read as rounded rather than sharp.
 *   See the comment above create_d4_geometry for how the chamfer arg works;
 *   each shape's value can be tuned independently to taste.
 * - added stuck-roll recovery: constructor setup was split out into _build()
 *   so it can be re-run cleanly, and hard_reset() tears down + rebuilds the
 *   whole renderer/scene/world in place. A watchdog timer (_start_watchdog/
 *   _clear_watchdog) starts on every roll()/reroll() and auto-triggers
 *   hard_reset() if `rolling` is still true ~15s later — covers silent WebGL
 *   context loss (renderer.domElement now also listens for
 *   webglcontextlost/restored directly) and any other exception that could
 *   otherwise leave `rolling` stuck true forever, silently no-oping every
 *   future click. hard_reset() is a public method, so it also works as a
 *   manual "stuck? tap to reset" button from your own UI. Optional
 *   box.on_stuck callback fires after an automatic recovery so the UI can
 *   surface a toast/notice if desired.
 * - line_up_dice() now wraps into multiple rows instead of cramming every die
 *   into one row with shrinking spacing — high dice counts (e.g. 10) were
 *   ending up packed close enough to overlap. New vars.lineup_min_spacing_scale
 *   is the knob for this: the floor on how close together dice are allowed to
 *   get (as a multiple of vars.scale) before an extra row is added. Also added
 *   vars.lineup_row_spacing_scale for the vertical gap between rows.
 * - line_up_dice() now also spins each die around its up-face's own normal so
 *   the printed label reads upright toward the camera, instead of whatever
 *   yaw the physics tumble left it at. Derived exactly from the face's own
 *   UV data (compute_face_bitangent, standard tangent/bitangent construction)
 *   rather than guessed per-shape constants, so it should hold up for every
 *   face shape including d10's irregular kite faces. Skipped for d4 (its
 *   3-numbers-per-face / read-by-edge convention doesn't fit this model).
 *   Toggle via vars.upright_labels_enabled. NOTE: unverified against an
 *   actual render — if labels come out upside-down or mirrored, flip the
 *   sign at the "angle = -angle" comment in compute_upright_correction.
 * - added apply_mod(notation_index, delta, after_mod): nudges a single
 *   settled die's shown value (e.g. a "mod token" +1/-1 mechanic) by
 *   relabeling its already-up face via the same cyclic shift_dice_faces
 *   trick reroll() uses for forced results — no movement, no re-throw, just
 *   an instant relabel, kept in sync with last_notation. Clamps to the die's
 *   face range by default (see the comment at the clamp for how to wrap
 *   instead). vars.mod_pulse_enabled toggles a small cosmetic scale-pulse on
 *   the modded die.
 * - fixed the root cause behind occasional stuck/garbage rolls: cannon's
 *   solver can rarely go numerically unstable (NaN position/quaternion),
 *   which previously rode out check_if_throw_finished's own ~10s force-finish
 *   safety cap and then silently surfaced as get_dice_value returning -1 for
 *   every affected die — the _start_watchdog/hard_reset system never even
 *   saw a problem, since the throw "completed" (with garbage). __animate now
 *   checks for this every frame (dice_state_corrupted) and, on detection,
 *   signals failure via a null result instead of computing values from
 *   corrupted data. Both throw_dices and reroll() catch that null and
 *   auto-retry with a fresh random throw (never replaying the failed one, up
 *   to 2 retries) before a bad result can ever reach after_roll/after_reroll;
 *   before_roll/before_reroll are only ever invoked once per user-initiated
 *   call, not once per retry. Falls back to hard_reset() + box.on_stuck if
 *   still failing after 3 total attempts. Also dropped some inert dead code
 *   (the commented-out playSound loop's now-unused numDice calculation).
